1. Go to the page that has the inventory items;
2. Access the item that you want;
3. Fill the form in the "Reserve This Item" section of the page and click on "Reserve" button;
4. Once you have been redirected to the "Your reservation has been submited" page, add the **ENCODED** payload ```%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E``` in the ```message``` parameter in the URL;

# Bonus

You can also add a **DOUBLE ENCODED** malicious payload, and the attacker will be able to bypass some security controls such as not accept quotes.

The used payload: ```%253Cscript%253Ealert%2528%2522pwned%2520by%2520daniloalbuqrque%2522%2529%253C%252Fscript%253E```
